## Section 4: Configuring the Custom Purchase Tag for TikTok in Google Tag Manager

In this section, we focus on setting up a custom purchase tag in Google Tag Manager (GTM) for TikTok pixel integration. To accomplish this, we'll leverage a template provided by the TikTok pixel team. Follow these steps:

1. **Access Google Tag Manager**: Log into your GTM account and open the container linked to your Shopify store.

2. **Use the TikTok Pixel Template**: Choose the TikTok Pixel tag template, available in GTM's template gallery. This template is specifically designed for TikTok pixel integration.

3. **Configure the Tag Settings**: In the tag configuration, set the 'Pixel ID' to the variable storing your TikTok Pixel ID. For the event type, select 'Complete Purchase'.

4. **Set Up Data Layer Variables**: Ensure you extract necessary user data, such as email and phone, using Data Layer Variables. This information is crucial for accurate tracking and attribution.

5. **Define Event Parameters**: Use the G4 data layer system for defining event parameters like 'currency', ensuring they align with your e-commerce setup.

6. **Assign a Trigger for the Tag**: Create a custom event trigger that activates for the specific purchase event. Use the event name that matches your data layer script.

7. **Finalize and Save Your Tag**: After setting up the configurations, save your tag. Ensure it's aptly named for easy identification, like 'TikTok Purchase Event'.

## Section 5: Testing and Verification of the TikTok Purchase Event Tag

After configuring the tag, it's essential to test and verify its functionality.

1. **Activate Preview Mode in GTM**: In your GTM dashboard, enable the preview mode. This action will connect the GTM container with your Shopify store for testing purposes.

2. **Conduct a Test Purchase**: Visit your Shopify store, add a product to the cart, and proceed to checkout. Use a test mode or a 100% discount code to simulate a purchase transaction.

3. **Inspect the Purchase Event on the Thank You Page**: After completing the purchase, check the GTM debug window for the custom purchase event. Ensure it's triggered as expected.

4. **Utilize TikTok Pixel Helper for Verification**: With the TikTok Pixel Helper tool, confirm that the 'Complete Purchase' event is firing correctly on the thank you page.

5. **Check Data Layer for Accurate Event Data**: Ensure that all the transaction details, including the transaction ID, value, and product information, are correctly transmitted. Also, verify that user data such as email and phone number are captured if provided.

6. **Finalize and Publish the GTM Container**: Once you have confirmed that the purchase event is tracking correctly and the data is accurate, go ahead and publish the changes in your GTM container. This step will activate the tracking on your live Shopify store.

## Conclusion

In summary, setting up and verifying a custom purchase tag for TikTok in Google Tag Manager involves a series of methodical steps to ensure accurate data tracking and integration with your Shopify store. By accessing GTM, creating a new tag using the TikTok Pixel template, configuring tag settings, defining event parameters, and assigning the correct trigger, you establish a robust foundation for tracking TikTok purchase events. Testing and verification are crucial, involving GTM's preview mode, conducting test purchases, using the TikTok Pixel Helper, and thoroughly checking the data layer for correct event data.

The process culminates in the finalization and publication of the GTM container, ensuring that the tracking is live and functional on your store. This setup not only enhances your understanding of customer behavior on your Shopify site but also empowers you to optimize your TikTok advertising campaigns based on precise and reliable data. With this in place, you're well-equipped to leverage the full potential of TikTok's advertising capabilities, aligning your online store's marketing strategies with data-driven insights.

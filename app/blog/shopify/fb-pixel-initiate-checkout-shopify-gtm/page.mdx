### Introduction

In this blog, we'll learn how to set up the Facebook Pixel's Initiate Checkout event on a Shopify store using Google Tag Manager (GTM) web containers. The process is divided into five sections for clarity and ease of implementation.

## Step 1: Setting Up Google Tag Manager on Shopify

Firstly, we'll set up the GTM container on your Shopify store to track various events:

1. Access your GTM dashboard.
2. Note the container ID.
3. Copy the head and body tracking snippets.
4. On Shopify, navigate to Online Store -> Themes -> Edit code.
5. Duplicate your theme file for backup.
6. Paste the head code under the `<head>` section and body code under the `<body>` section of the `theme.liquid` file.
7. Save changes and verify the GTM container is live.

## Step 2: Configuring Page View Event for Facebook Pixel

Next, we configure the base tag for Facebook Pixel:

1. Go to Facebook Event Manager and copy your Pixel (now called a Data Source) ID.
2. In GTM, use the Facebook Pixel tag template for easier setup.
3. Create a new tag for the Facebook Pixel, setting it to fire on all pages.
4. Use a constant variable for the Pixel ID for future convenience.
5. Verify the pixel fires correctly using Pixel Helper.

## Step 3: Setting Up Initiate Checkout Script in Shopify

## Step 4: Finalizing Tags, Triggers, and Variables in GTM

In this step, we create the necessary components in GTM:

1. Set up a custom event trigger matching the Begin Checkout event.
2. Create variables for e-commerce data like items, value, and currency.
3. Implement a Facebook parameter generator variable for detailed event tracking.
4. Create a new GTM tag for the Initiate Checkout event with the appropriate triggers and variables.

## Step 5: Testing and Publishing

Finally, we test and publish our setup:

1. Use GTM's preview mode to test the tag functionality.
2. Simulate a checkout on your Shopify store and monitor event firing.
3. Once verified, publish the GTM container to apply changes live.

This setup will allow you to effectively track the Initiate Checkout event on your Shopify store via Facebook Pixel, providing valuable insights into your customers' shopping behaviors. For detailed scripts and more information, refer to the video description.

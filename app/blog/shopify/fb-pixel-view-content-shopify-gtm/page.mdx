## Section 1: Configuring Google Tag Manager on Shopify

1. Go to your GTM Container, click on the container ID or navigate to 'Admin' > 'Install Google Tag Manager' to get the code snippets.
2. Copy the 'Head' snippet and paste it right under the `<head>` tag in the `theme.liquid` file on Shopify.
3. Copy the 'Body' snippet and paste it just after the opening `<body>` tag in Shopify.
4. Save changes and use GTM's preview mode to verify the setup.

## Section 2: Setting Up Facebook Pixel Base Code

1. In Facebook Business Manager, navigate to 'Event Manager' > 'Data Sources'.
2. If you have a Pixel created, select it; otherwise, create a new one.
3. Copy the Pixel's base code.
4. In GTM, create a new tag with this base code as a 'Custom HTML' tag.
5. Set the trigger for all pages and save.

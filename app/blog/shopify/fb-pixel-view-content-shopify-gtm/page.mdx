##### Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore configuring the 'View Content' event for Facebook Pixel on a Shopify store using Google Tag Manager (GTM). This is particularly useful if you're not using Shopify's built-in Facebook and Instagram app.

##### Prerequisites

1. Google Tag Manager Container
2. Active Shopify Store
3. Facebook Business Manager Account with a Facebook Pixel

##### Section 1: Configuring Google Tag Manager on Shopify

1. Go to your GTM Container, click on the container ID or navigate to 'Admin' > 'Install Google Tag Manager' to get the code snippets.
2. Copy the 'Head' snippet and paste it right under the `<head>` tag in the `theme.liquid` file on Shopify.
3. Copy the 'Body' snippet and paste it just after the opening `<body>` tag in Shopify.
4. Save changes and use GTM's preview mode to verify the setup.

##### Section 2: Setting Up Facebook Pixel Base Code

1. In Facebook Business Manager, navigate to 'Event Manager' > 'Data Sources'.
2. If you have a Pixel created, select it; otherwise, create a new one.
3. Copy the Pixel's base code.
4. In GTM, create a new tag with this base code as a 'Custom HTML' tag.
5. Set the trigger for all pages and save.
6. Alternatively, use Facebook's custom template in GTM for a simpler setup.

##### Section 3: Setting Up 'View Content' Event Scripts

###### DataLayer Code Snippets Overview

The provided code snippets aim to integrate the `dataLayer` object for Google Tag Manager (GTM) with a Shopify store. The main goal is to send an event called `custom_view_item` whenever a user visits a product page on Shopify.

###### Head DataLayer Code

This code initializes the `dataLayer` array if it hasn't been already. It then checks if the current page template is a 'product' page and renders a specific snippet called 'datalayer-product'.

```jsx
<script>
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
</script>

{%- if template contains 'product' -%}
  {%- render 'datalayer-product', product: product -%}
{%- endif -%}
```

###### Product DataLayer Code

This code snippet contains the main logic for populating the `dataLayer` object with product details whenever a product page is viewed:

1. It first captures the current variant of the product.
2. It constructs an `itemObject` containing various product details.
3. On document load, it pushes this data to the `dataLayer` object.

```jsx
{%- liquid assign current_variant = product.selected_or_first_available_variant -%}

<script>
  console.log("datalayer-product snippet is loaded")
  var itemObject = {
      item_id: {{ current_variant.id | json }},
      id: {{ current_variant.id | json }},
      item_name: {{ product.title | json }},
      currency: {{ shop.currency | json }},
      item_brand: {{ product.vendor | json }},
      item_category: {{ product.type | json }},
      item_variant: {{ current_variant.title | json }},
      price: {{ current_variant.price }} / 100,
      google_business_vertical: 'retail',
      quantity: 1
  }

  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
      dataLayer.push({ ecommerce: null });
      dataLayer.push({
          event: "custom_view_item",
          ecommerce: {
          currency: {{ shop.currency | json }},
              items: [itemObject]
          }
      });
  })
</script>
```

###### Theme DataLayer Code

This code renders the `head-datalayer` snippet. Depending on the setup of your Shopify theme, this is likely where the head datalayer code resides. Add this code GTM Body Code.

```jsx
{% render 'head-datalayer' %}
```

###### Steps to Add the DataLayer Code Snippets in Shopify:

1. Backup: Before making any changes, always backup your current theme.

2. Access Theme Files:

   - Login to your Shopify Admin.
   - Go to Online Store > Themes.
   - Click on the "Actions" dropdown for your live theme and select "Edit code".

3. Add Head DataLayer Code:

   - In the left sidebar, locate and click on `theme.liquid`.
   - Insert the "Head DataLayer Code" snippet within the `<head>` tags.

4. Add Product DataLayer Code:

   - Click "Add a new template" or "Add a new snippet" depending on your Shopify version.
   - Name it `datalayer-product.liquid`.
   - Insert the "Product DataLayer Code" snippet into this new file.
   - Save changes.

5. Add Theme DataLayer Code:

   - Determine where you want this code to render (usually within the `<head>` tags in `theme.liquid`).
   - Insert the "Theme DataLayer Code" snippet in the desired location.
   - Save changes.

6. Test:
   - Visit a product page on your Shopify store.
   - Open browser's developer console.
   - Confirm that the `custom_view_item` event is fired and the `dataLayer` object contains the correct product details.

Remember, these instructions assume a typical Shopify setup. Some custom themes might require a different approach. Always test thoroughly before and after making changes.

##### Section 4: Creating Tags for 'View Content' Event in GTM

1. Create a new trigger in GTM for the custom 'View Item' event.
2. Set up necessary variables for enhanced e-commerce tracking in GTM.
3. Create a custom HTML tag or use the Facebook Pixel template tag in GTM.
4. Ensure the tag fires the 'View Content' event with the correct parameters.
5. Verify the setup through GTM's preview mode and Facebook Pixel's helper.

##### Section 5: Testing and Publishing

1. Publish your GTM changes with a descriptive version name.
2. Test the integration using Facebook Pixel's debug view.
3. Ensure the 'View Content' event is firing correctly with all required parameters.

##### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can successfully configure the 'View Content' event for Facebook Pixel on your Shopify store using Google Tag Manager. This setup is crucial for accurate tracking and data collection for your marketing efforts.

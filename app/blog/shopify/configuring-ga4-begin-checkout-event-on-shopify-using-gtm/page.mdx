#### Introduction

Hello, everyone! In today's blog, we'll be diving deep into the configuration of Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and Google Tag Manager for your Shopify store. Our main focus will be on tracking the "begin checkout" event, which indicates the user is nearing the final "thank you" page but is still on the cart page.

<YoutubeEmbed embedId={metadata.embedId} />

#### Prerequisites

Before we jump in, ensure you have the following:

- A Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics 4 account.
- A Shopify store with the Google Tag Manager web container already installed.

If you haven't set these up yet, you can refer to [this page](/blog/shopify/configure-google-tag-manager-on-your-shopify-store).

#### Sections Covered

This blog is divided into three main sections, aiming to cover everything from basic event tracking setup to the specifics of configuring 'begin_checkout' events.

1. Web Configuration Tags: This covers how to track basic events like page views, user engagement, and session starts.
2. Begin Checkout Data Layer: How to directly trigger the Begin Checkout event from Shopify and send enhanced e-commerce data to Google Analytics 4.
3. Configuring GTM for dataLayer event & Testing: Ensuring everything has been configured correctly and publishing the Google Tag Manager containers.

#### Section 01: Web Configuration Tags

First up, let's set the groundwork with a configuration tag on Google Tag Manager.

1. Analytics Measurement ID: Navigate to your [analytics account](analytics.google.com) to obtain the GA4 measurement ID. This unique ID facilitates data transmission from your website back to Google Analytics.

   - On the lower left corner, choose `Admin`.
   - Within the 'Property Settings' column, select `Data Stream`. These data streams operate akin to pipelines, bridging data flow.
   - If you already possess a data stream, great! If not, you can create one. Once set, copy the measurement ID.

2. Google Tag Manager - Creating Variables: Switch over to the [Google Tag Manager container](tagmanager.google.com). Here, we'll create variables to reuse IDs efficiently.

   - Head to the `Variable` section.
   - Click `New` > `Tag Configuration`.
   - Opt for the `Constant` variable (since the Measurement ID remains unchanged across users).
   - Label it `GA4 Measurement ID`.
   - Save your changes.

3. Tag Creation: With the Measurement ID constant in place, it’s time to create our first tag.

   - Top right, select `New`.
   - This configuration tag should be active across all website pages. Hence, choose the trigger for built-in all pages.
   - Under tag configuration, select the `Google Tag` (the newer version of the older Google Analytics 4 configuration tag).
   - For the tag ID, opt for the GA4 measurement ID constant we created earlier.
   - Label the tag as `GT GA4 Configuration Tag`.
   - Save.

#### Testing the Configuration Tag

To ensure our configuration tag operates smoothly:

1. Click `Preview` > Input your website’s URL.
2. Use the Google Tag Assistant [Chrome extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tag-assistant-legacy-by-g/kejbdjndbnbjgmefkgdddjlbokphdefk) to make sure the tags active on your website.
3. Cross-verify by navigating directly to the analytics account. Under `Admin`, choose `Debug View`. All default events (page_view, session_start) connected through the preview window to your Shopify store will be displayed here.

#### Section 02: Begin Checkout DataLayer with Enhanced E-Commerce Data

This section is for those who wish to capture more data, like the item_id, item_name, value, quantity, etc., when the "begin_checkout" event is triggered.

#### Instructions for Developer

Send over [this document](/static/pdf/blog/shopify/configuring-ga4-begin-checkout-event-on-shopify-using-gtm.pdf) to the developer else following the blog below

#### DataLayer Code Snippets Overview

The provided code snippets aim to integrate the `dataLayer` object for Google Tag Manager (GTM) with a Shopify store. The main goal is to send an event called `custom_begin_checkout` whenever a user clicks the Begin Checkout button on the Cart page on Shopify.

#### Head DataLayer Code

This code initializes the `dataLayer` array if it hasn't been already. It then checks if the current page template is a 'product' page and renders a specific snippet called 'datalayer-product'.

```jsx
<script>
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
</script>

{%- render 'datalayer-checkout' -%}
```

#### Checkout DataLayer Code

This code snippet contains the main logic for populating the `dataLayer` object with product details whenever a Begin Checkout Event is triggered on the Cart page:

- Initial Logging:Outputs a message to verify the script is loaded.
- Cart Data & Product Details: Retrieves cart data from Shopify and transforms cart items for Google's ecommerce tracking format.
- Cart Total Value: Computes the total value of items in the cart.
- Begin Checkout Event Listener: It waits for the page to load and then identifies checkout buttons. For each button: Clears previous `dataLayer` ecommerce data on click and pushes new ecommerce data to the `dataLayer` for Google Tag Manager tracking.

```jsx
<script>
  console.log("datalayer-checkout snippet is loaded");

  cart_data = {{ cart | json }};

  var product_details = cart_data.items.map(function(item) {
    return {
      item_id: item.id,
      id: item.id,
      item_name: item.product_title,
      item_brand: item.vendor,
      item_category: item.product_type,
      quantity: item.quantity,
      currency: {{ shop.currency | json }},
      google_business_vertical: 'retail',
      price: parseFloat(item.price / 100.0)
    };
  });

  var cartTotalValue = cart_data.items.reduce(function(acc, item) {
    return acc + (item.price * item.quantity);
  }, 0);

  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const BeginCheckout = document.querySelectorAll('[name="checkout"]');
    BeginCheckout.forEach((CartItem, index) => {
      CartItem?.addEventListener('click', () => {
        dataLayer.push({ ecommerce: null });
        dataLayer.push({
          event: "custom_begin_checkout",
          ecommerce: {
            items: product_details,
            value: parseFloat(cartTotalValue / 100.0),
            currency: {{ shop.currency | json }}           }
        });
      });
    });
  });
</script>
```

#### Theme DataLayer Code

This code renders the `head-datalayer` snippet. Depending on the setup of your Shopify theme, this is likely where the head datalayer code resides. Add this code GTM Body Code.

```jsx
{% render 'head-datalayer' %}
```

#### Steps to Add the DataLayer Code Snippets in Shopify:

1. Backup: Before making any changes, always backup your current theme.
2. Access Theme Files:
   - Login to your Shopify Admin.
   - Go to Online Store > Themes.
   - Click on the "Actions" dropdown for your live theme and select "Edit code".
3. Add Head DataLayer Code:

   - In the left sidebar, locate and click on `theme.liquid`.
   - Insert the "Head DataLayer Code" snippet within the `<head>` tags.

<Note
 title='Tip'
 content='Always ensure your code is correctly formatted for readability and error prevention.'
/>

4. Add Checkout DataLayer Code:

   - Click "Add a new snippet" depending on your Shopify version.
   - Name it `datalayer-checkout.liquid`.
   - Insert the "Checkout DataLayer Code" snippet into this new file.
   - Save changes.

5. Add Theme DataLayer Code:

   - Determine where you want this code to render (usually within the `<head>` tags in `theme.liquid`).
   - Insert the "Theme DataLayer Code" snippet in the desired location.
   - Save changes.

6. Test:
   - Visit a Cart page on your Shopify store and click BeginChecout button.
   - Open browser's developer console.
   - Confirm that the `custom_begin_checkout` event is fired and the `dataLayer` object contains the correct product details.

<Note
 title='Tip'
 content="The custom prefixes added to event names (like 'custom_begin_checkout') prevent any conflicts with other possible integrations or plugins that might be using standard event names."
/>

#### Section 03: Setting Up Google Tag Manager for Enhanced Event Tracking

To accurately track these events, we need to set up appropriate triggers and tags in Google Tag Manager.

#### Setting Up the Trigger

1. Navigate back to the Tag Manager.
2. Opt for "Triggers" and create a new trigger.
3. Under trigger configuration, search for "custom event".
4. Name the custom event as `CE custom_begin_checkout` and set the value to "custom_begin_checkout".

<Note
 title='Tip'
 content="Using a 'custom_' prefix ensures that the 'begin checkout' does not mix with any other events on your website."
/>

#### Setting Up Event Parameters

For additional tracking details, such as items, revenue, etc., Google Tag Manager's latest version introduces G4 event parameters, similar to setting variables in Universal Analytics.

1. Search for "Google tag event settings".
2. You'll encounter three parameters: items, currency, and value.
3. For items, currency and value, refer to the Data Layer and create dataLayer varibale for each.
4. Name it `DLV items`, `DLV currency` and `DLV value` .
5. Name this event setting as `GTES GA4 EEC Event parameters`.

<Note
 title='Tip'
 content="Ensure you use the correct notations, whether it's a dot for objects or indexes for arrays, to avoid errors."
/>

#### Creating an Event Tag for Google Analytics 4

1. Return to the tag section and formulate a new event tag for Google Analytics 4.
2. Select the previously created trigger for `CE custom_begin_checkout`.
3. For the event, choose `Google Analytics 4 Event Tag`.
4. Ensure the `GA4 Measurement ID` matches the one created at the beginning of this blog.
5. For the event parameter, refer back to the same event setting parameter used earlier i.e., `GTES GA4 EEC Event parameters`.

#### Testing and Preview on GA4

After these configurations, test to ensure all parameters are working as expected. You can do this by initiating a checkout on your Shopify store and verifying that the Data Layer populates correctly, and the triggers fire as intended. Additionally, confirm the successful transmission of all parameters, such as items and currency, to Google Analytics 4.

#### Publish the Changes on GTM

Conclusing this section, always remember to publish your changes in Google Tag Manager. Failing to do so means your edits remain as drafts and won't reflect on the live website.

#### Conclusion

Integrating Google Analytics 4 (GA4) with Shopify using Google Tag Manager (GTM) offers e-commerce businesses a deeper understanding of their customer's journey. By effectively tracking the 'begin checkout' event, businesses can gain actionable insights into user behaviors and preferences, providing opportunities for optimization. Following this step-by-step guide ensures accurate data capture, enhancing decision-making and strategy formulation. As e-commerce continues to evolve, ensuring robust tracking mechanisms remains crucial. By leveraging the power of GA4 and GTM, retailers can ensure they're well-equipped to navigate the ever-changing landscape of online commerce. Happy tracking!

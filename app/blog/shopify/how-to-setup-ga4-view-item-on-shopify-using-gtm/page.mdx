### Introduction

Hey there, friends!

Ever wondered which products on your online store are getting the most attention? Or wished you could gauge how visitors interact with your items? Well, today's your lucky day! I'm here to guide you through setting up a 'view item' event using Google Analytics 4 (GA4), Google Tag Manager, and your Shopify store. 🛒

### 🚀 Getting Started

First things first, there are some things you'll need to have ready:

1. Google Tag Manager container set up on your Shopify store.
2. An active Shopify account.
3. A Google Analytics 4 property created.

### 🔗 Connecting GA4 with Google Tag Manager

Follow these steps to connect your GA4 property with Google Tag Manager:

1. Head over to your Google Analytics.
2. Look for the 'Admin' option at the bottom left.
3. Navigate to 'Data Streams' under the property column.

Here, you'll find a 'Measurement ID'. This ID is our golden ticket. Copy it and hop back to Google Tag Manager. We'll use this ID a lot, so it's smart to create a variable for it.

### 🧐 Creating a View Item Trigger

To monitor when someone checks out a product, follow these steps:

1. In Google Tag Manager, navigate to triggers.
2. Create a trigger for a custom event called 'view_item'.
3. Rename it to avoid duplicates.

Follow up by setting up a tag:

1. Choose the trigger you just created.
2. Select the GA4 event.
3. Use the Measurement ID variable and set the event name to 'view item'.

<Note

### 💻 Coding Time: Setting Up the View Item Event on Shopify

For the non-code savvy:

1. Go to your Shopify store dashboard.
2. Click on 'Online Store', then 'Themes'.
3. Create a duplicate of your theme before editing any code.
4. Hit 'Edit Code'.
5. Add the required JavaScript code for 'view item' events.

### 🎯 Final Steps: Sending Event Parameters to GA4

Complete the setup with these steps:

1. Return to Google Tag Manager.
2. Under 'Variables', create settings for 'value' and 'currency'.
3. Add these details to your event in GA4.

Once you've done this, test everything once more.

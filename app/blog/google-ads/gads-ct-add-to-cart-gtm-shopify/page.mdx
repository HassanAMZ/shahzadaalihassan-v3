## Section 1: Setting Up Google Tag Manager on Shopify

To begin tracking, the first step is integrating Google Tag Manager with your Shopify store:

1. **Access GTM Account**: Log into your GTM account and note your container ID.
2. **Implement GTM Snippets**:
   - Go to your Shopify admin, navigate to Online Store > Themes.
   - In the theme editor, find the `<head>` and `<body>` tags.
   - Insert the GTM head snippet below the opening `<head>` tag and the body snippet immediately after the opening `<body>` tag.
3. **Verify the Integration**:
   - Use GTM's 'Preview' mode to confirm that the container is firing correctly across all Shopify pages.

Before diving into conversion tracking, it's essential to ensure that GTM is firing correctly on your Shopify store:

1. **Access GTM Container ID**: In your GTM dashboard, click on your container ID to view the head and body tracking scripts.
2. **Integrating Scripts on Shopify**:
   - Navigate to the 'Online Store' section of your Shopify dashboard.
   - Go to 'Themes', click 'Actions', and then 'Edit Code'.
   - Locate the `<head>` tag and paste the GTM head script.
   - Find the opening `<body>` tag (use Ctrl + F for convenience) and paste the GTM body script.
3. **Save Changes**: Format the code, save the file, and verify the scriptâ€™s functionality on your store.

          Reflection is a powerful tool for personal growth and self-awareness.
          One method that has gained popularity for its simplicity and
          effectiveness is the "Wheel of Life". It allows individuals to divide
          their life into key areas and rate their current level of satisfaction
          or alignment in each. This blog post introduces an interactive "Wheel
          of Life" component that you can integrate into your web applications
          to help users perform this exercise digitally.

        <h3 className="pb-6 text-2xl font-bold">What is the Wheel of Life?</h3>

        <p className=" ">
          The Wheel of Life is a circular diagram that represents various life
          aspects, such as health, relationships, and work. Each section is
          rated on a scale from 0 to 10, indicating how satisfied or aligned one
          feels in that area. The goal is to identify areas that are thriving
          and others that may require more attention.

    <h3 className='text-2xl font-bold  pb-6'>What is the Wheel of Life?</h3>

    <p className=' '>
     The Wheel of Life is a circular diagram that represents various life
     aspects, such as health, relationships, and work. Each section is rated on
     a scale from 0 to 10, indicating how satisfied or aligned one feels in that
     area. The goal is to identify areas that are thriving and others that may
     require more attention.
